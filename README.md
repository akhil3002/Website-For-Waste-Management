THERE ARE BASICALLY 3 MODULES:

Registered users can upload photos of their waste materials. They can provide details such as waste type (plastic, e-waste, scraps), quantity, and any additional relevant information.






Admin Module: 

This module allows administrators to manage and control various aspects of the website, such as content management, user management, settings configuration, and other administrative tasks.The admin is responsible for reviewing and approving the waste photos uploaded by users. The admin verifies the uploaded content, ensuring compliance with guidelines and acceptable waste materials. Upon approval, the waste images become visible to scrap dealers for further processing.






Dealer Module: 

This module provides a dashboard for scrap dealers to view the approved waste photos and related information. Scrap dealers can assess the feasibility of recycling or repurposing the waste materials based on the uploaded photos. They can initiate contact with users for waste collection and negotiate terms.
